This requires https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows to convert mp3 to wav.
I included the file here, because although it is legit, the website really looks super fishy and hard to find the correct download.

Use the python script (or the exe) to get and convert mp3 files from Anno1404 to wav.
Then install Wwise with "Wwise Install v2019.2.15_Build7667" (https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/download/)
 it is free, but you have to register your email. Installation can take roughly 20 minutes.
Then use the Anno1800_wwise_Project (read the HowToUse.txt) in it, to create the soundbanks with these wav files.
Then continue to use the python script (exe) to create the assets.xml/text_.xml file for your 1800 mod.
